# CPU Usage Monitoring and Visualization

This project visualizes real-time CPU usage by users on a Unix-based system using data collected from the `top` command. The visualization is displayed as a dynamic pie chart, updated every second, showing how much CPU is being used by each user and how much remains unused.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of CPU usage.
- Dynamic pie chart visualization.
- Easy setup using Python, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`.

## Prerequisites

- Unix-based operating system (e.g., Linux or macOS).
- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Required Python libraries: `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `numpy`.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swapnil0651/cpu-usage-visualization.git
cd cpu-usage-visualization
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the libraries manually:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy
```

## Running the Project

To start the project and visualize CPU usage, run:

```bash
python cpu_usage_visualization.py
```

The pie chart will be displayed, showing CPU usage by different users and the unused CPU percentage, updated every second.

## Customization

You can modify the chart refresh rate by changing the `interval` parameter in the `FuncAnimation` function. The default is set to `1000` milliseconds (1 second):

```python
ani = FuncAnimation(fig, update_pie_chart, interval=1000)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No valid CPU data found**: This message indicates that no valid CPU usage data could be retrieved. Ensure the `top` command is available on your system.
- **Negative CPU values**: If negative CPU usage values appear, the script will handle them by resetting them to 0 and printing a warning.
